# 50.001-IS-1D-PROJECT
The problem that has been identified by the team is the increase in congestion time on Singaporeâ€™s road, especially during peak hours. ParkMe is an app that aims to help motorist locate the nearest available carpark in his location. With such an app, it will reduce the need for motorist to wait at the carparks during peak hours and create congestion.
